    "text": "The Osprey (Pandion haliaetus) is a partial migratory bird species with a broad distribution across North America. Partial migration means that not all populations migrate, and the extent of migration depends on geographical location and environmental conditions. Ospreys breeding in northern latitudes (e.g., Canada and the northern United States) are typically obligate migrants, traveling to Central and South America for the winter. Those in southern parts of the United States may be year-round residents, depending on food availability and climate.\nMonitoring bird populations and migration patterns is vital for understanding ecological dynamics and informing conservation efforts. However, traditional monitoring approaches, such as field observations and curated datasets like eBird, are often resource-intensive and may leave gaps in spatial and temporal coverage. As such, there is a growing need to explore complementary data sources that can fill these gaps.\nThis project investigates the potential of social media as an alternative data source for ecological monitoring by focusing on the seasonal occurrences and geographical distribution of Ospreys across the United States. Using geotagged Flickr photos and comparing them to formal bird observation data from eBird, the study aims to assess the extent to which trends in the presence and migration patterns of Ospreys captured through social media align with patterns documented in citizen science databases. By highlighting the utility of photo-based social media data, this project seeks to advance our understanding of how platforms like Flickr can contribute to ecological and avian studies, offering a scalable and accessible tool for biodiversity monitoring.\n\n\n\nOsprey Image"
